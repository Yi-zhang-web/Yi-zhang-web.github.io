excerpt: 'A test strip has been developed for the rapid detection of the illegal additive ethyl anthranilate (EA) in wine. The detection scheme is based on a combination of photonic crystal based detection and molecular imprinting based recognition. The resulting molecularly imprinted photonic crystal (MIPC) undergoes a gradual color change from green to yellow to red upon binding of EA. A semi-quantitative colorimetric card can be used to estimate the content of EA, either visually or by making use of an optical fiber spectrometer. A linear relationship was found between the Bragg diffraction peak shift and the concentration of EA in the range from 0.1 mM to 10 mM. The detection limit is 10 Î¼M. The test has been successfully used to screening for the presence of EA in grape wine. The test strip is selective, and can be re-used after re-activation.'
