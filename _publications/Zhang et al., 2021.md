excerpt: 'With the rapid development of China's economy and the acceleration of urbanization, the production of municipal solid waste (MSW) has increased rapidly, which has had a serious adverse effect on the environment. Source separation of waste is an effective way to achieve high recovery rates in urban areas and reduce environmental risks. This research optimizes the theory of planned behavior with the employment of the normative activation model and the attitude-behavior-condition theory. A measurement model is thus conceptualized to explore the determinants of the separation intention and behavior of Chinese urban residents. In particular, a case study based on questionnaires in Shenzhen (in southern China) and Tianjin (in northern China) was conducted before the similarities and differences of the two megacities were identified in a comparative analysis. The findings of statistical analysis and structural equation model verification show that subjective norms have exerted the most significant impact on Shenzhen residents' separation intention, but perceived behavioral control takes a dominant position in Tianjin. Also, the satisfaction with government policies has the most extensive impact on the separation behavior of Shenzhen residents, while complete separation facilities are the biggest contributor to the popularization of waste separation in Tianjin. Furthermore, the study investigated the moderating effect of contextual factors and verified the significant effect of government policies and incentive methods. Finally, it provided some useful recommendations for governments to enhance the efficiency of MSW source separation promotion.'
